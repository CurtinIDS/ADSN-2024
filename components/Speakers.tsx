        keynote_topic: "Reimagining Healthcare: Better Outcomes Through Digital Innovation",
        keynote_abstract: "The digital health revolution offers unprecedented opportunities to transform healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including data science and analytics, we can revolutionize how we diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases. This presentation will explore the factors limiting the translation of research into practice, including knowledge transfer, regulatory barriers, and resource constraints. We will also discuss strategies to bridge this gap, such as fostering collaboration, establishing effective knowledge exchange mechanisms, and addressing regulatory hurdles.\nFurthermore, we will delve into the importance of a skilled workforce in the digital health sector. Healthcare professionals, data scientists, and technology experts must be equipped with the necessary skills to develop and implement innovative solutions. This requires ongoing education, training, and upskilling programs. By harnessing the power of data science and analytics, we can unlock new insights, improve decision-making, and accelerate the development of innovative digital health solutions. This will ultimately lead to better patient outcomes, enhanced healthcare delivery, and a more patient-centred healthcare system.",

        keynote_topic: "Leveraging the power of social media analytics",
        keynote_abstract: "Social media has become an integral part of daily life, transforming the publicâ€™s role from passive consumption (\"read-read\") to active participation (\"read-write\"). It not only exerts a significant influence on human decision-making processes but also reshapes our societal structures. In this context, leveraging the power of social media analytics has never been more critical and urgent, particularly in addressing global challenges such as climate change and modern slavery.",

        biography: "Professor Warren Mansell's work focuses on transdiagnostic interventions for mental health, including the development of digital health tools such as Manage Your Life Online (MYLO). His research is grounded in Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a model that explains behaviour as a purposeful, dynamic control system. This approach informs his work on the Method of Levels Therapy for mental health issues and guides his exploration into communication in dementia, robotics, and consciousness. Professor Mansellâ€™s work highlights the potential of digital health and data science in advancing mental health interventions by enabling robust, individualized models for predicting and improving mental health outcomes. He brings insights from his roles across Oxford, King's College London, and the University of Manchester, where he previously served as a Reader in Clinical Psychology.",
        keynote_topic: "MYLO: Applying Data Science to a Rule-Based Conversational Agent to Support Problem Clarification for Wellbeing and Mental Health",
        keynote_abstract: "MYLO is a rules-based system that engages the user in a text-based conversation about a current problem. Its architecture is informed by control systems engineering and research evidence on the active ingredients of psychological change. Through MYLO's curious questioning, the user is supported in problem expression (putting their thoughts and feelings into words), problem clarification (exploring the problem in greater depth and detail), and problem resolution (seeing the problem from a new perspective and getting insights). The Curtin Institute of Data Science implemented two rounds of codesigned improvements to MYLO - a progressive web application for smartphones - and an improvement to its database and decision-making and learning algorithms. We report on the impact of these improvements, and our plans for integrating large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) within MYLO to generate a hybrid in the next round of improvements ahead of commercialisation.",
